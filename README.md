                                                                        Overview
My project aims to develop a Color Detection Application that enables users to upload an image, click on any pixel, and instantly retrieve the closest matching color name along with its RGB values. This is particularly useful for designers, developers, and artists who need accurate color identification for branding, accessibility, or creative purposes.

Proposed Solution

The application will:

- Allow users to upload an image via a Streamlit interface.

- Detect colors by capturing pixel data using OpenCV.

- Extract the RGB values and match them against a predefined dataset (colors.csv).

- Display the closest color name alongside a visual representation of the detected color.

Technologies Used

- Python (Primary programming language)

- OpenCV (Image processing)

- Streamlit (Web application interface)

- Pandas (Data handling for color matching)

- GitHub (Version control)

Solution Architecture & Workflow

- Image Upload - Users upload an image via the web interface.

- Mouse Interaction - Users click on any pixel in the image.

- Color Extraction - The system retrieves the RGB value of the clicked pixel.

- Color Matching - The application compares the RGB value against a dataset to find the closest color.

- Result Display - The UI shows the color name, RGB values, and a color box for reference.

Challenges & Feasibility

- Ensuring accurate color matching (potential improvements using LAB color space).

- Handling edge cases like unsupported image formats.

- Maintaining a fast and responsive UI for large images.

Future Enhancements

- Add support for HEX codes and HSL values.

- Implement zoom/magnifier features for precise color selection.

- Allow users to export color palettes.

- Improve color matching using KNN algorithms.

- This project has high potential impact, especially in design, branding, and accessibility applications, making color identification efficient and accurate.
